# Contributing

I'm happy to view and accept pull requests. However, it is important to follow these guidelines if you want to contribute.

## Reporting issues

* Make sure there's not already an issue (open or closed) regarding your issue.
* Include detailed information and steps to reproduce. Any issues opened with no description will be ignored.
* Include a screenshot(s) of the issue (if it's possible).

## New features, UI changes, and infrastructure changes

Please make sure you discuss these with me in the issue tracker before opening a pull request. It's good to get a conversation going first to make sure that everyone is on the same page, and this way you don't accidentally invest a lot of time into something I don't want to merge. That said, i am always open to these, so please don't hesitate to start the discussion!

## General steps

* [Fork](https://github.com/Voonder/IllustratorMobileAssets/fork) the repository.
* Create a local clone of the repository.
* Create a local branch (see the [Rules](#rules) section)
* Commit your code, and push the changes to your own repository.

## Rules

* Branch names should start with either `feature_` or `bugfix_`. If there is an open issue, include its number, like `bugfix_123`.
* **Do not** include in your commit message anything related to automatic issue closing, such as `Fixes issue 123`. I'll do that when merging your pull request.
* Try to keep the diff as small as possible. For example, be aware of auto formatting.
